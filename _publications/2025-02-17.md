Gesture recognition in resource-constrained scenarios faces significant challenges in achieving high accuracy and low latency. The streaming gesture recognition framework, Duo Streamers, proposed in this paper, addresses these challenges through a three-stage sparse recognition mechanism, an RNN-lite model with an external hidden state, and specialized training and post-processing pipelines, thereby making innovative progress in real-time performance and lightweight design. Experimental results show that Duo Streamers matches mainstream methods in accuracy metrics, while reducing the real-time factor by approximately 92.3%, i.e., delivering a nearly 13-fold speedup. In addition, the framework shrinks parameter counts to 1/38 (idle state) and 1/9 (busy state) compared to mainstream models. In summary, Duo Streamers not only offers an efficient and practical solution for streaming gesture recognition in resource-constrained devices but also lays a solid foundation for extended applications in multimodal and diverse scenarios.
