With the light control circuit as a starting point，the open experimental platform as the infrastructure，junior college students are guided to progress through“layers”in the well－organized experimental courses，and to improve their basic technical skills and innovative designing capabilities through the unique discovery and inquiry teaching methods of“learning in practice”． In the process of progressive practice，students gradually accumulate experimental experience and skills，their potential is constantly nourished and developed． They gradually gained a sense of success，this will help students maintain their enthusiasm for learning and exploring activities，and lead them beyond imitation and stereotyping． The students will do the lighting circuits in different novel ways，this will cultivate their sense of innovation and transcendence． The open experiment course realizes the training of students’ innovative thinking．
